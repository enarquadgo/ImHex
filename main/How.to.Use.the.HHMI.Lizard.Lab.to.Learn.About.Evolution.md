# How to Use the HHMI Lizard Lab to Learn About Evolution
 
The HHMI Lizard Lab is a virtual lab that allows students to explore the evolution of anole lizards in the Caribbean. The lab consists of four modules that cover different concepts in evolutionary biology, such as adaptation, convergent evolution, phylogenetic analysis, reproductive isolation, and speciation. In each module, students collect and analyze data, perform statistical calculations, and answer questions based on their findings. The lab is designed to reinforce key science practices and skills, such as measuring phenotypic traits, comparing DNA sequences, constructing phylogenetic trees, and testing hypotheses.

In this article, we will provide a brief overview of each module and some tips on how to use the HHMI Lizard Lab answer key to check your understanding and improve your learning outcomes.
  
## Module 1: Ecomorphs
 
In this module, students learn about ecomorphs, which are species with similar body types and habitats. Students sort eight lizards into categories based on their relative limb length and toe pad size. They then measure these traits for each lizard using a virtual caliper and a scale. Students use these measurements to calculate the mean, standard deviation, standard error of the mean (SEM), and the 95% confidence interval for each trait and each category. They also compare their results with those of other students and discuss the sources of variation in their data.
 
The HHMI Lizard Lab answer key for this module provides the correct measurements and calculations for each lizard and each category. It also provides explanations for why certain lizards have certain traits and how they are adapted to their environment. For example, the answer key explains that lizards with short legs are better suited for crawling on slim twigs, while lizards with long legs are better suited for jumping between tree trunks.
  
## Module 2: Phylogeny
 
In this module, students learn about phylogeny, which is the evolutionary history of a group of organisms. Students use DNA sequence analysis to determine which lizards are more closely related to each other. They align DNA sequences from different lizards using a computer program called ClustalW. They then construct a phylogenetic tree based on the number of differences between the sequences. They also compare their tree with a published tree based on morphological data.
 
The HHMI Lizard Lab answer key for this module provides the correct alignment and phylogenetic tree for the lizards. It also provides explanations for why certain lizards are more similar or different from each other based on their DNA sequences. For example, the answer key explains that lizards from different islands may have diverged from a common ancestor due to geographic isolation.
  
## Module 3: Experimental Data
 
In this module, students learn about experimental data, which is data collected from controlled experiments. Students design and conduct an experiment to test whether habitat affects the behavior of lizards. They choose two habitats (grass or trunk) and two types of lizards (short-legged or long-legged) to compare. They then observe how many times each lizard runs or perches in each habitat using a virtual stopwatch and a tally sheet. They use these observations to calculate the mean and SEM for each variable and each group. They also perform a statistical test called a t-test to determine whether there are significant differences between the groups.
 
The HHMI Lizard Lab answer key for this module provides the correct observations and calculations for each variable and each group. It also provides explanations for why certain lizards behave differently in different habitats based on their adaptations. For example, the answer key explains that short-legged lizards run more often in grass because they can hide from predators more easily, while long-legged lizards perch more often on trunks because they can escape from predators more quickly.
  
## Module 4: Speciation
 
In this module, students learn about speciation, which is the process by which new species arise. Students investigate how reproductive isolation can lead to speciation in lizards. They choose two populations of lizards from different islands and measure their dewlap color using a virtual spectrometer. They then compare their results with those of other students and discuss whether there is evidence of reproductive isolation between the populations.
